# Welcome!
Here, i share my completed data science projects purely for self-learning and hobby purposes. The projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. In addition, i also keep a list of useful data science articles that have helped me in my learning journey. 

# About Me
I am Joanna and i graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with a Bachelor in Mathematical Sciences (Statistics) in 2018. I am an aspiring Data Scientist and i have strong interest in the domain of Machine Learning. You can find my linkedin profile [here](https://linkedin.com/in/joannakhek/)
